README for 7.3p3
Release Notes

Release: 7.3
Patch: 3

Patch Deliverable:

  identityiq-7.3p3.jar

General Information:

  IdentityIQ 7.3p3 is a patch for IdentityIQ 7.3.  All patches are cumulative,
  so this patch includes all changes from previously released patches for
  IdentityIQ 7.3.

  If you are deploying IdentityIQ using a war file, you will need to
  update the war file contents with those from this patch using the
  following sample commands as a guide.  Place identityiq.war and
  identityiq-7.3p3.jar in the current working directory and use the
  following commands to update the war file:

    mkdir iiq-7.3p3
    cd iiq-7.3p3
    jar xf ../identityiq-7.3p3.jar
    jar uf ../identityiq.war *

Installation Instructions:

  1. Stop the application server (or the IdentityIQ application
     if supported by the application server).

  2. Un-jar the IdentityIQ patch in the IdentityIQ installation
     directory.

  3. Using a database client, execute the
     upgrade_identityiq_tables-7.3p3 DDL script in WEB-INF/database
     that is appropriate for your database type.  The database scripts are
     cumulative, so you will receive errors for the schema changes that have
     already been applied in previous patches.

  4. Apply the patch by using a command line interface to execute the command
     "iiq patch 7.3p3" (without the quotes) from the WEB-INF/bin directory.

  5. Start the application server (or the IdentityIQ application if
     supported by the application server).

Upgrade Considerations:

  - This patch contains fixes for a set of important security vulnerabilities.
    - The first is a remote code execution vulnerability where a logged-in 
    authenticated IdentityIQ user can cause undesired code to run on an 
    IdentityIQ server due to deserialization of user-supplied JSON formatted 
    input.
    - The second is a vulnerability in the validation of SAML assertions 
    where a valid and cryptographically signed SAML assertion can be modified   
    and still considered valid for authentication. Exploiting this vulnerability 
    requires successful authentication to a SAML Identity Provider trusted by 
    IdentityIQ, but modifying the assertion prior to validation can allow 
    impersonating another IdentityIQ user.
    - The third is the potential for deciphering the encryption contained in
    the network protocol that IdentityIQ components use to communicate with the
    IQService. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the ability to capture
    network traffic that is sent to the IQService.
    - The fourth is the possibility that an unknown client can successfully
    communicate with the Connector Gateway or Mainframe Connector outside of
    the intended context.  Exploiting this vulnerability requires the ability
    to capture network traffic that is sent to the Connector Gateway and/or
    Mainframe Connector and an understanding of the proprietary communication
    protocol used in communication with the Mainframe Connector via the
    Connector Gateway.  To resolve this vulnerability, the IdentityIQ
    application configuration must be changed for all applications that require
    the Mainframe Connector.
      • Use TLS as a communication protocol
      • Add Client Authentication credentials to allow the Mainframe Connector
        to authenticate the IdentityIQ Server.
    The fix includes IdentityIQ changes, a new Connector Gateway package and a
    fix for Mainframe Connectors.

    As with all software vulnerabilities, we recommend that 
    all customers apply this patch or the security fixes for IIQSR-148, 
    IIQETN-7708, CONETN-2645, and CONETN-2732 along with
    ConnectorGateway-Jul-2019 and Mainframe Connectors fix (FSD0116) available
    in the Product Download Center on Compass as soon as possible.

  - The JSONDeserializerFactory class has been deprecated. The "deserialize"
    and "deserializeList" methods survive but will simply pass through to the
    JsonHelper. The FlexJSON JSONDeserializer class has also been deprecated.
    Any custom code or rules should be updated to eliminate any usages of the
    FlexJSON JSONDeserializer class or the JSONDeserializerFactory class, and
    instead use the JsonHelper class. All JSON inputs must be properly formed
    with keys and string values surrounded by either single or double quotes.

  - This release includes the ability to integrate with IdentityAI by providing
    recommendations in both certifications and approvals.  In conjunction with
    IdentityAI licensing, certifications and approvals have the ability to
    display a recommended decision within the UI.  Using historical and group
    analysis gathered from the organization, this feature will suggest a
    decision for approves, revokes, and approvals next to the associated
    options.  Users still have the option to make their own selections.

  - The Oracle HRMS Connector now supports the creation of employee records in
    Oracle HRMS. It is not the best practice to create records into HRMS via
    automated means, however.  It is recommended to use this feature from an
    efficiency perspective, in case, if Oracle HRMS is not the authoritative
    source of the employee information as by design, Oracle EBS only accepts
    person ID from its HRMS systems. This feature helps provide access to
    employees to Oracle EBS modules based on appropriate permissions. The
    feature also supports termination workflow during employee separation.
    Aggregation performance has been improved in this release.

  - The Mainframe Integration Modules now support the configuration of Pre
    and Post Scripts return codes from Mainframe connectors. Add the below 
    entries in the application configuration to support these changes:
      <entry key="failWhenSkip" value="true/false"/> 
      <entry key="failWhenWarn" value="true/false"/> 

  - The IQService now offers enhanced security of the communication channel
    between IdentityIQ and IQService using TLS and client authentication. All
    transactions are now authenticated and encrypted. Applications of all
    connectors that use IQService now have IQService User and IQService
    Password fields which are mandatory if an IQService is configured to
    communicate over TLS.

  - When using the Active Directory connector, if "groupMembershipSearchDN" is
    not configured, all the group memberships assocaited with respective
    accounts will be fetched without being restricted to the user's search
    scope defined by searchDNs.  If the desired behavior is to restrict the
    group memberships for a given account then define the required scope under
    "groupMembershipSearchDN". 
 
  - In order to provide better support for upgrading from one plugin version to
    another, there are new requirements enforced for plugin version number
    formats. Plugin version numbers must be numeric, contain no alphabetic or
    other characters, and separate the elements of the version number with
    decimal points. Within each segment of the version number (the values
    between the decimal points), the values are cast as integers, and leading
    zeroes are trimmed. Hence "04" is interpreted as "4", as is "00004." A
    segment containing any non-numeric values will be interpreted as 0. A
    version of "1.004.alpha" will be parsed as "1.4.0" A version of "2.3.4a"
    will be parsed as "2.3.0". The single exception is version numbers with
    "-dev" appended to the end. This suffix causes version number validation to
    bebypassed. See the "Plugin Upgrades" section of these release notes for
    more information.  Attempted plugin upgrades to versions that do not
    support this pattern may fail depending on how the version number is
    interpreted.

  - As of this release, snapshot isolation in SQL Server now is enabled by
    default in the database upgrade scripts, which matches the database
    creation scripts. The settings enabled are ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION and
    READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT.  This facilitates locking without excessive
    blocking.  As a result of this change, administrators can expect an
    increase in the utilization of the SQL Server tempdb resource.

  - As of this release, OpenJDK 8 is now supported for Red Hat Enterprise
    Linux and CentOS in combination with Tomcat or JBoss as the application
    server. In addition, AdoptOpenJDK 8 is now supported for Windows
    platforms.

Upgrade Considerations - IdentityIQ 7.3 Patch 2:

  - This patch contains fixes for a set of important security vulnerabilities.
    These vulnerabilities allow a logged-in, authenticated user to gain
    privileges beyond their assigned capabilities, including gaining
    system administrator access.  The impact of these vulnerabilities is high,
    but exploitation requires knowledge of IdentityIQ's web user interface
    architecture.  Vertical privilege escalation is possible due to Java EL
    evaluation of user-supplied input. Remote code execution is possible due to
    Java deserialization using user-supplied input.  As with all software
    vulnerabilities, we recommend that all customers apply this patch or the
    e-fixes for IIQETN-7523 and IIQTC-118 available in the Product Download
    Center on Compass as soon as possible.

  - The IBM Tivoli Directory Server LDAP connector now supports an
    'Unlock Account' feature. To enable the 'Unlock Account' feature for an
    upgraded application, the following attributes must be added to the
    application xml:
      featuresString: UNLOCK
      Attributes:
	      <entry key="lockAttr" value="pwdAccountLockedTime"/>
        <entry key="unlockAttr">
          <value>
            <List>
              <String>pwdFailureTime</String>
              <String>pwdAccountLockedTime</String>
            </List>
          </value>
        </entry>    
        
  - The Workday connector now supports the Include_Additional_Jobs response
    group.  To leverage this functionality, the following attributes must be
    added to the application xml:
      <entry key="Include_Additional_Jobs" value="true"/>
      <entry key="version" value="30.1"/>
    The existing attribute XPATHs will need to be updated according to version
    30.1 of the API.
 
  - The Box connector now supports Delta aggregation. To leverage this
    functionality, the following atttibutes must be updated in the application
    xml:
      <entry key="deltaUserEventsList">
        <value>
          <List>
            <String>DELETE_USER</String>
            <String>NEW_USER</String>
            <String>EDIT_USER</String>
            <String>GROUP_ADD_USER</String>
            <String>GROUP_REMOVE_USER</String>
          </List>
        </value>
      </entry>
      <entry key="deltaGroupEventsList">
        <value>
          <List>
            <String>GROUP_CREATION</String>
            <String>GROUP_DELETION</String>
            <String>GROUP_EDITED</String>
          </List>
        </value>
      </entry>
 
  - The SuccessFactors connector now has support for a Termination Date schema
    attribute for Employees and Contingent workers. To leverage this
    functionality in existing applications, add the schema attribute
    "Termination Date" as a "String" type and a Description as "Populates the
    Termination Date for Employees and WorkOrder End Date for Contingent
    Workers."
 
  - The RSA Authentication Manager connector now supports RSA Authentication
    Manager version 8.3 and 8.4. For existing applications, ensure that the
    entry key with the "rsaVersion" attribute does not exist in the
    application xml when upgrading from any previous version. For example,
    the below entry should be removed from application xml, if present: 
      <entry key="rsaVersion" value="8"/>

Upgrade Considerations - IdentityIQ 7.3 Patch 1:

  - This patch contains a fix for a set of important security vulnerabilities.
    These vulnerabilities allow a logged-in, authenticated user to gain
    privileges beyond their assigned capabilities, including gaining
    system administrator access.  The impact of these vulnerabilities is high,
    but exploitation requires knowledge of IdentityIQ's web user interface
    architecture.  Vertical privilege escalation is possible due to
    unauthorized modification of a role or unauthorized assignment of an
    approval work item.  As with all software vulnerabilities, we recommend
    that all customers apply this patch or the e-fix for IIQETN-7058 available
    in the Product Download Center on Compass as soon as possible.

  - The credential cycling (or AIM) integration for CyberArk now uses methods
    that will utilize HASH as the authentication mechanism to ensure that they
    are passed securely.  This requires that administrators run a CyberArk
    utility to generate the hash. On Linux it would look similar to:
      java -jar JavaAIMGetAppInfo.jar GetHash -AppExecutablesPattern=build/WEB-INF/lib/pam-credential.jar 
    On Windows, the format is slightly different.  Just replace the second "-"
    with "/" or:
      java -jar JavaAIMGetAppInfo.jar GetHash /AppExecutablesPattern=build\WEB-INF\lib\pam-credential.jar
